# LangBuddy – Multilingual Friendship Platform

LangBuddy is a **learning project** built using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)**.  
The main objective of this project was to **understand API integration, backend–frontend communication, and deployment structure** in a full-stack application.
It was created as a **practice project** to strengthen my understanding of web development concepts.
